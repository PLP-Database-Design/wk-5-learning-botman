## Test Executor Report

### Execution Results

Total: 8 test cases | Pass: 6 (75%) | Fail: 2 (25%)

### Test Cases

TC01: Answer Validation ‚úÖ  
Risk: TS-1 | Priority: High  
Got word "vascjaript" ‚Üí typed "javascript" ‚Üí showed "Correct! +10 points". Score went 0‚Üí10. Works good.

TC02: Leaderboard Saves ‚úÖ  
Risk: TS-3 | Priority: Critical  
Solved 3 words, got 30 points. Leaderboard showed "30 ü•á". Hit F5 refresh ‚Üí leaderboard still shows 30. localStorage working!  
Checked DevTools ‚Üí found localStorage['leaderboard'] = "[30]". Good.


TC03: Shuffle Button ‚ùå
Risk: TS-4 | Priority: Medium
Looked for the "Shuffle" button to rearrange the current puzzle letters. Can't find it anywhere! Only see: Submit, Hint, New Puzzle, Reset.

TC04: Hint Behavior ‚úÖ
Risk: TS-5 | Priority: Low
The score was 10. Clicked Hint once ‚Üí lost 2 points (now 8), saw hint text "Step-by-step recipe to solve a problem". Clicked Hint again ‚Üí got message "You've already used your hint for this puzzle!". Score stayed at 8. Fixed properly!

TC05: Reset Game ‚ùå
Risk: TS-6 | Priority: Medium
Had a score of 15, solved 2 puzzles. Clicked Reset ‚Üí score went to 0, solved count to 0. However, the puzzle word stayed the same ("mrkewafor") and didn't load a new one. Had to click "New Puzzle" manually.
Bug: Reset doesn't clear the current puzzle display.
Defect: Issue #1

TC06: Mobile View ‚ùå
Risk: TS-7 | Priority: High
Opened DevTools, switched to Galaxy S21 (360√ó800). Buttons are wrapped okay, but the input box is super narrow. In landscape mode, the "Bonus at" counter disappeared off the edge.
Bug: Layout is cramped on small phones.
Defect: Issue #3

TC07: Wrong Answer (Negative) ‚úÖ
Priority: Medium
Word was "debugging", typed "random" ‚Üí got "Incorrect, try again!" message. Score didn't change. Good error handling.

TC08: Empty Input (Negative) ‚úÖ
Priority: Medium
Left input blank, clicked Submit ‚Üí got "Please enter a guess!" message. Nothing broke. Good validation.

TC09: Bonus Round ‚úÖ
Priority: High
Solved 3 puzzles in a row (got 10, 10, 10). After 3rd ‚Üí saw "üéâ Bonus Round! Score doubled!" Score jumped from 30 to 60. Counter reset to "Bonus at: 3". Bonus math correct!

**Progress Tracking Method:** Jira / Tello boards for task tracking; GitHub Issues for defects and PRs.  
**Change Control Notes:** Defects logged as Issues #1‚Äì#3; severity assigned and ready for dev fixes. Test Manager to approve fixes and schedule retest.

## Lessons Learned

- Most Defect Prone Feature: Reset / UI behaviors (Reset not fully clearing state; mobile layout issues).  
- Risk Analysis Impact: Prioritization correctly highlighted leaderboard and input/score risks; enabled focused test coverage.  
- Team Communication Effectiveness: Clear handover from Test Executor to Test Manager; include screenshots/evidence in GitHub Issues to speed triage.  
- Improvements for Next Cycle: Add Shuffle feature spec or remove from test matrix if not intended; add responsive CSS tests; automate smoke tests to catch regressions early.

## Attachments

- localStorage screenshot showing "[30]" (leaderboard persistence) ‚Äî include when uploading evidence.  
- DevTools screenshots for mobile layout and input width.  
- Test execution logs (attach here or reference GitHub Issue attachments).

## Overall Summary

**Statement:** The Word Puzzle Game Plus shows solid core functionality: answer validation, hint behavior, leaderboard persistence, and bonus-round math are working as expected. Three defects were found (Reset not loading a new puzzle, missing Shuffle button, and mobile layout issues). The current execution produced a 75% pass rate.  

**Test Status:** ‚òê Completed / ‚òë In Progress / ‚òê Deferred  
-- Remaining: implement fixes for Issues #1‚Äì#3, retest affected cases (TC03, TC05, TC06), and update metrics after retest.
2. Toggle device mode, pick Galaxy S21 (360√ó800)  
3. Try using a game  
Expected: Everything readable and usable  
Actual: Input field squished, bonus counter cuts off in landscape  
Impact: Hard to use on small phones. Not terrible, but annoying.  
Note: Works okay on bigger screens. Just tiny phones struggle.

### Metrics

| Metric | Value | Formula / Notes |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Pass Rate | 75% (6/8) | 6 passed out of 8 total test cases (as executed) |
| Defect Density | 0.375 (3 √∑ 8) | 3 defects over 8 test cases |
| Risk Coverage | 75% (6/8 risks) | 6 of 8 identified risks covered by executed tests |

### Untested Risks

- TS-2: Score math bugs (didn't find any wrong calculations)  
- TS-8: Performance lag (game ran smoothly, no lag noticed)

### What I Found

Good stuff:  
- Bonus round math is accurate (√ó2 every 3 solves)  
- Leaderboard saves properly to localStorage  
- Hint only works once per puzzle now  
- Enter key works for submitting

Needs fix:  
- Reset should auto-load the new puzzle  
- Mobile spacing could be better

Exit Status: 75% pass rate. Not bad, but the Reset bug should be fixed before launch.

### Notes for Test Manager

Done:  
- All 8 cases tested  
- 3 bugs logged with steps  
- Checked bonus round manually (works!)  
- Metrics calculated  

Handover:  
- Fix Issue #1 (Reset doesn't load new puzzle - medium priority)  
- Fix Issue #2 (Shuffle button missing - high priority)  
- Fix Issue #3 (Mobile layout cramped - medium priority)  
- Retest TC03, TC05, and TC06 after dev fixes  

Time spent: About 3 hours total

###
- 
 - Verify functional correctness of the core game features (puzzle scramble, guess evaluation, hint behavior, scoring, bonus round, reset).
 - Validate persistence and ordering of the leaderboard across sessions (top-3 behavior in localStorage).
 - Execute risk-based test cases (functional, negative, and usability) and log defects with reproduction evidence.
 - Produce test metrics (Test Case Pass %, Defect Density, Risk Coverage, Regression Success Rate) and deliver final report by 2025-10-28.
### Scope

**In Scope:**
- 

**In Scope:**
- Functional testing of core features: New Puzzle, Submit Guess, Hint, Reset Game, Score calculation and Bonus Round.
- Leaderboard behavior and persistence in `localStorage` (top-3 ordering, save/load across refreshes).
- Risk-based test cases (minimum 8 test cases including ‚â•2 negative and ‚â•1 usability test).
- Accessibility basics (keyboard Enter to submit, ARIA labels present) and desktop Chrome compatibility.
- Automation: implement smoke automation for critical flows using Selenium (web) and Appium for any mobile responsive verification.

**Out of Scope:**
- Backend or server-side integrations (there is no server component in the current app).
- Multi-user or networked leaderboard (concurrent sessions, server-side ranking).
- Cross-browser exhaustive testing beyond Chrome (full cross-browser matrix may be deferred to future cycles).
- Major refactors of game logic or UI redesigns ‚Äî only small, low-risk bug fixes recommended.

**Out of Scope:**
-
